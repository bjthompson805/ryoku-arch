#   1) pin NetworkManager's wifi backend to iwd in the target. base set ships
#      iwd (not wpa_supplicant), and the live ISO already runs NM over iwd
#      (installation/iso/airootfs/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-backend.conf).
#      that drop-in lives only on the ISO. without an equivalent in the target,
#      NM falls back to wpa_supplicant, finds nothing, wifi can't associate.
#
#   2) copy the saved connection profiles NM wrote while the user joined a
#      network during install (/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
#      *.nmconnection) into the target, preserving the 600 root:root perms NM
#      requires. otherwise the credentials evaporate on reboot.
